# blockchain-www-crawler
Whether you are to build next google, or just another clever SaaS tool. You often need access to WWW index - and that demands crawling. Renting the servers that crawl and later process data can be expensive (citation needed).

This repository acts as a 'thought experiment' where we discuss 
* How expensive can crawling and processing be (for a search engine, for a vertical search engine, for a typical SaaS tool)
* How many consumers can this solution attract. Would there be enough customers who would want to use this 'blockchain based crawler' that A: crawls the internet and B: processes the data on request
* How affordable can such solution actually be in comparison to regular cloud providers or putting up your own clusters
* What engineering challenges lie ahead in establishing a marketplace on blockchain where miners can contribute crawled data (where they are penalized for contributing false data). 
* and more..?
